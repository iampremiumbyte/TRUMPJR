          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Donald John Trump Jr. (born December 31, 1977) is an American
            businessman, former television presenter, political activist, and
            author. He is the eldest child of former U.S. President Donald Trump
            and his first wife Ivana Trump. Trump Jr. was born on December 31,
            1977, in Manhattan, New York City, to Ivana and Donald Trump.[17] He
            has two younger siblings, Ivanka and Eric. He also has two half
            siblings, Tiffany, from his father's marriage to Marla Maples, and
            Barron, from his father's current marriage to Melania Trump. Through
            his father, Trump is a grandson of Fred Trump and great-grandson of
            Elizabeth Christ Trump, who founded what became the Trump
            Organization. As a boy, Trump found a role model in his maternal
            grandfather, Miloš Zelníček, who had a home near Prague, where he
            spent summers camping, fishing, hunting and learning the Czech
            language.
